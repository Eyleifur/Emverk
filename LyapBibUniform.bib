  Abstract                 = {In this paper a class of Piecewise Quadratic Lyapunov Functions (PQLFs) for the analysis of the robust stability of linear systems subject to polytopic uncertainties is considered. These functions are obtained by partitioning the state space into polyhedric conical sets and by associating to each cone a quadratic form. This class of Lyapunov functions is not only a generalization of quadratic Lyapunov functions but it also (strictly) contains the class of polyhedral Lyapunov functions. The latter implication directly proves the universality of these functions for the robust stability problem and justifies the effort of finding a Lyapunov function belonging to this class. The technicalities for an effective use of this class of functions to test the robust stability of linear uncertain systems will be detailed. Numerical examples show that the proposed methodology allows one to obtain results that, compared with the actual state of the art, perform better under several viewpoints.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a methodology for the algorithmic construction of Lyapunov functions for the transient stability analysis of classical power system models. The proposed methodology uses recent advances in the theory of positive polynomials, semidefinite programming, and sum of squares decomposition, which have been powerful tools for the analysis of systems with polynomial vector fields. In order to apply these techniques to power grid systems described by trigonometric nonlinearities we use an algebraic reformulation technique to recast the system's dynamics into a set of polynomial differential algebraic equations. We demonstrate the application of these techniques to the transient stability analysis of power systems by estimating the region of attraction of the stable operating point. An algorithm to compute the local stability Lyapunov function is described together with an optimization algorithm designed to improve this estimate.},

The problem of the synthesis of a feedback control, assuring that the system state is ultimately bounded within a given compact set containing the origin with an assigned rate of convergence, is investigated. It is shown that the problem has a solution if and only if there exists a certain Lyapunov function which does not belong to a preassigned class of functions (e.g., the quadratic ones), but it is determined by the target set in which ultimate boundedness is desired. One of the advantages of this approach is that we may handle systems with control constraints. No matching assumptions are made. For systems with linearly constrained uncertainties, it is shown that such a function may be derived by numerically efficient algorithms involving polyhedral sets. The resulting compensator may be implemented as a linear variable-structure control},

  Abstract                 = {In an earlier paper, the authors presented an algorithm for constructing a Liapunov function for a dynamical system. In this paper, we present theorems which allow the algorithm to be used
 in proving the asymptotic stability of dynamical systems, both difference and differential equations. The notion of an asymptotically stable set of matrices is introduced, and is shown to be a sufficient condition for the algorithm's termination in a finite number of steps. The instability stopping criterion is strengthened and the efficiency of the algorithm is improved in a number of ways. We investigate the tightness of our method by applying it to two-dimensional systems for which necessary and sufficient conditions for stability are known.},

  abstract = {Abstract Impulsive systems are a very flexible class of systems that can be used to represent switched and sampled-data systems. We propose to extend here the previously obtained results on deterministic impulsive systems to the stochastic setting. The concepts of mean-square stability and dwell-times are utilized in order to formulate relevant stability conditions for such systems. These conditions are formulated as convex clock-dependent linear matrix inequality conditions that are applicable to robust analysis and control design, and are verifiable using discretization or sum of squares techniques. Stability conditions under various dwell-time conditions are obtained and non-conservatively turned into state-feedback stabilization conditions. The results are finally applied to the analysis and control of stochastic sampled-data systems. Several comparative examples demonstrate the accuracy and the tractability of the approach.},

  Abstract                 = {The determination of a stability domain of a control system, the motion of which is described by nonlinear differential equations, is often the object of intensive experimental and theoretical
 attack. This paper, partly tutorial and partly a presentation of new results, describes a method for obtaining a solution to this problem proposed recently by the Russian mathematician, V. I. Zubov. The tutorial part outlines
 the fundamental principles of V. I. Zubov's procedure for constructing Lyapunov functions for non-linear systems. If the construction problem can be solved, it leads to a Lyapunov function which uniquely defines the exact
 boundary of the stability region. For the application of the method, several simple examples are treated in which the exact stability region is found in analytic closed form. Since the construction procedure requires the
 solution of a linear partial differential equation, there are many cases for which an exact analytic solution is not possible. In some of these cases, however, it is possible to construct an approximate series solution
 which is always at least as good as the usual quadratic form Lyapunov function. The series construction procedure has been programmed (in IBM 7070 FORTRAN language) for a broad class of differential equations of the
 second order. A simple example solved by the digital computer program is described.},

  abstract  = {The purpose of this paper is to propose a generalization of piecewise linear Lyapunov functions (PLLFs). In original PLLF candidates, functions are parameterized by hyperplanes, which intersect the stability region and stability conditions are formulated as linear programming problems (LPs) in terms of the parameters inserted by the hyperplanes. The piecewise linear hyperplanes (PLHPs) were introduced to reduce the size of LPs and produce a new class of PLLF candidates; however, applicable systems of this idea were restricted in a certain class of systems. In this paper, this restriction is removed and new PLLF candidates are characterized as the sum of piecewise linear functionals corresponding to PLHPs.},
